Advent of Code 2020 Solver
===
This is a repo to store the solutions I've comed up with for the 2020 edition of Advent of Code.
This might be useful if you're stuck with a puzzle and need a reference number to help you debug.

To use, simply run aoc.php from the command line, indicating the day as parameter, for example:

`php aoc.php day1`

This will read the file named "input.txt" placed in the Resources/dayX, so feel free to clone and substitute this with 
your own inputs.

Happy coding!

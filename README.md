Advent of Code 2020 Solver
===
This is a repo to store the solutions I've come up with for the 2020 edition of Advent of Code.
This might be useful if you're stuck with a puzzle and need a reference number to help you debug.

Before you start, you need Composer installed, as I use it for class autoloading purposes. Once its installed,
 you must run the following command in the directory root:

`composer dump`

Now to use it, simply run aoc.php from the command line, indicating the day as parameter, for example:

`php aoc.php day1`


This will read the file named "input.txt" placed in the Resources/day1, so feel free to clone and substitute this with 
your own inputs.

Happy coding!
